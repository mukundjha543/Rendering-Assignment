# Python OpenGL Sphere Grid

This project demonstrates the use of Pygame and OpenGL in Python to render a 6x6 grid of spheres in a window. The spheres are illuminated by a simple light source, and clicking anywhere in the window changes the color of all spheres to a random color. Pressing the ESC key exits the application.

## Features

- Rendering a 6x6 grid of spheres using OpenGL.
- Basic lighting setup to illuminate the spheres.
- Mouse click event changes the color of the spheres to a random color.
- ESC key press event to safely exit the application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer.
- Pygame for window management and event handling.
- PyOpenGL for rendering.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.
3. Install the required Python packages. Navigate to the project directory and run:

# inorder to install requirements run this command
